## Overview
If you want to control traffic flow at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4), NetworkPolicies allow you to specify rules for traffic flow within your cluster, and also between Pods and the outside world. Your cluster must use a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy enforcement.

> [!warning]
> - Network policy should apply on the target pod (Not the source pod)
> - Focus only on Ingress rule
> - If **Egress** is not defined, outbound traffic is **allowed by default**.
> - Always double-check **podSelector** and **from.podSelector**.
